# Ad fontes shift scheduler

This project poses the scheduling of shifts at the Ad fontes bar as a constraint satisfaction problem.

The scheduling is solved in four steps:

1. Domain consistency
2. Full random assignment
3. A combination of simulated annealing and random local search.
4. Greedy search.
